# Final-Project
the creation of a time crunch theme game in Godot
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 21st, 2022

## Theme
We interpreted the time crunch theme as the character having the ability to control the flow of time

## Game Play
The objective for the player is to save time
Follow the platforms, dodge enemies, and complete some parkour to find the portals to the next area

WASD - Movement

Spacebar - Slow time

## Impediments
The lack of time impeded on some of our ideas.

## Implementation
Features:
- Multiple Levels
- Time Slow feature
- Moveable character
- 1 enemy type

Assets, or resources used:
- kenny.nl - 2D platformer kit (tilemap, enemy)
- Opengameart - [box](https://opengameart.org/content/box-2) by Alekei
